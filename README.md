# MazeSolver

## Description:
MazeSolver is a Python project that utilizes Tkinter for generating and solving mazes. It implements a maze generation algorithm based on recursive backtracking and a maze-solving algorithm. The generated maze is displayed using the tkinter graphics library.

## Features:
- Maze generation using recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Maze solving using a recursive algorithm.
- Visualization of maze generation and solving.
- User input for maze dimensions.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Rohitlyengar/MazeSolver.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install tkinter, which is the only required dependency. Depending on your Python installation, tkinter may already be included. If not, you can install it using the package manager for your operating system:
- For Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```
- For Fedora:
  ```
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```
- For macOS:
  ```
  brew install python-tk
  ```
- For Windows:
  tkinter is included with Python by default.


## Usage:
1. Run the `main.sh` script:
2. Enter the number of rows and columns for the maze when prompted.
3. The generated maze will be displayed in a tkinter window.
4. Once the maze is generated, the program will attempt to solve it.
5. If the maze is solvable, "Maze solved!" will be printed; otherwise, "Maze cannot be solved!" will be printed.
6. Close the window to exit the program.
